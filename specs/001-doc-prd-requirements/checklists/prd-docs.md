**Purpose**: Validate PRD requirements quality and docs linkage clarity
**Created**: 2026-02-17
**Feature**: specs/001-doc-prd-requirements/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all agreed requirements required to be listed in the PRD? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are requirement types explicitly included (functional and non-functional)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK003 Are testing scope notes required in the PRD? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK004 Are UX consistency notes required for impacted flows? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK005 Are performance targets required for key user actions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK006 Is “testable and unambiguous” defined with objective criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK007 Are “response-time targets” clarified with measurable thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Ambiguity]
- [x] CHK008 Is “Requirements section” defined as a dedicated, named section? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK009 Is “authoritative source” clarified to prevent conflicting interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK010 Do requirements about PRD content align across FR-001 through FR-011? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001..FR-011]
- [x] CHK011 Are docs linkage requirements consistent with “single source of truth” assumption? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK012 Do success criteria align with functional requirements without gaps? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-005, Spec §FR-001..FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and tied to requirement completeness? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK014 Are success criteria measurable for requirement clarity (testable, unambiguous)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK015 Is the “locate PRD in under 2 minutes” metric justified or calibrated? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are primary user journeys fully described for PRD updates and docs linkage? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK017 Are alternate flows described when requirements change mid-review? [Gap]
- [x] CHK018 Are exception scenarios for conflicting documentation explicitly addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are edge cases actionable (e.g., missed PRD update) with expected handling defined? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK020 Are conflicts between docs and PRD resolved by a defined rule? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-009]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK021 Are performance requirements in the PRD defined with measurable criteria? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK022 Are non-functional requirements explicitly included and scoped? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-007]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK023 Are assumptions about PRD authority and docs entry point validated or bounded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Is the “existing review process” referenced with enough clarity to be enforceable? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK025 Are any remaining vague terms (e.g., “complete,” “authoritative”) quantified or clarified? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK026 Is it explicit that docs must not include summarized requirements (to prevent drift)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Notes

- All items validated against `docs/prd.md` and `docs/README.md`.
- PRD location updated to `docs/prd.md`.
- Dedicated Requirements section added with Functional, Non-Functional, Testing, and UX sections.
