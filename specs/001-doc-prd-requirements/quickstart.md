# Quickstart: Documentation Requirements in PRD

## Goal
Ensure requirements are documented in the PRD and referenced from the docs
directory without duplication.

## Steps

1. Open the PRD and confirm a dedicated **Requirements** section exists.
2. Add all agreed requirements as testable statements in that section.
3. Include testing scope, UX consistency notes, and response-time targets for key
   user actions in the PRD.
4. In the docs directory, add or update a link that points to the PRD as the
   authoritative requirements source.
5. Verify no duplicate requirements appear elsewhere in docs.

## Validation

- Every requirement is testable and unambiguous.
- Requirements are located only in the PRD Requirements section.
- Docs directory links to the PRD and does not duplicate requirements.
